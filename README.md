## Scope
The solution is driven by a Jupyter notebook, consuming the datasets in the 'Data/' directory.

The solution provides the following features:

    - CSV data extraction.
    - Pandas data extraction.
    - Display in tabular format.
    - Visualisation.

When prompted, the user can specify patient attributes to filter and interpret data on:

    - Ethnic groups.
    - Treatment types.
    - Gender.

## Environment
The solution uses some external Python packages.

It is recommended to create a new Conda environment to manage these dependencies.

The ```environment.yml``` installs all of the dependencies when creating a Conda environment.

## Usage
Execute each cell, follow the on screen prompts.

Output data and plots are displayed in-line in the notebook, below the executed cell.
